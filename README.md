SQL (MySQL / PostgreSQL)

Streamlit (Dashboarding & Visualization)

ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)

Data Analysis & Visualization

Analytical Thinking & Documentation


***Problem Statement

With the increasing reliance on digital payments, it is essential to analyze transaction dynamics, user engagement, and insurance data. This project aims to:

Visualize aggregated values of payment categories.

Map transaction volumes across states and districts.

Identify top-performing states, districts, and pin codes.

Generate insights for better business decision-making.


*** Business Use Cases

Customer Segmentation â€“ Identify user groups based on spending habits.

Fraud Detection â€“ Detect anomalies in transaction patterns.

Geographical Insights â€“ Track payment activity across states & districts.

Payment Performance â€“ Analyze usage of different payment categories.

User Engagement â€“ Measure retention and activity levels.

Product Development â€“ Enhance services based on transaction insights.

Insurance Insights â€“ Analyze insurance transaction behavior.

Trend Analysis â€“ Understand seasonal and time-based variations.

Competitive Benchmarking â€“ Compare against competitors in the payments ecosystem.


*** Approach:

ðŸ”¹ Data Extraction

Clone PhonePe dataset from GitHub.

Load into a SQL database.

ðŸ”¹ SQL Database Setup

Create Aggregated Tables (users, transactions, insurance).

Create Map Tables (state & district-level mappings).

Create Top Tables (top states, districts, users, insurance).

ðŸ”¹ SQL Queries

Execute queries for each business case.

Extract aggregated insights from data.

ðŸ”¹ Python Analysis

Use Pandas for cleaning and transformation.

Use Matplotlib & Seaborn for charts (bar plots, pie charts, maps).

ðŸ”¹ Streamlit Dashboard

Build an interactive dashboard.

Display insights dynamically.

Enable real-time exploration of payment trends.
